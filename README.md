# Fraud-Detection-System
This fraud detection system works on a principle that the model identifies a certain transaction as fraud if the sender attempts to send a huge amount at a given time. Else, the transaction is considered not fraud. The model implements the decision tree algorithm to train the dataset after setting certain hyperparameters.

The dataset is simulated from a software called PaySim with mobile money transactions. The dataset was acquired from Kaggle.com
