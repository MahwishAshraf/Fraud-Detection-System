# Fraud-Detection-System
The proposed fraud detection system operates on the principle that a financial transaction is classified as fraudulent if the sender attempts to transfer an unusually large amount within a specified time period. Transactions that do not satisfy this condition are categorized as non-fraudulent.

For the development of this system, a Decision Tree algorithm was employed. The model was trained on the dataset following the adjustment of relevant hyperparameters to ensure optimal performance.

The dataset utilized in this study was generated using PaySim, a simulation tool designed to replicate mobile money transactions. This dataset was obtained from Kaggle.com, where it is publicly available for research purposes.
