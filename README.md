# Fraud-Detection-System
This fraud detection system works on a principle that the model identifies a certain transaction as fraud if the sender attempts to send a huge amount at a given time. Else, the transaction is considered not fraud. The model uses the SMOTE technique to balance the data and implements the decision tree algorithm to train the dataset after setting certain hyperparameters.
